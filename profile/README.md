# TechStudioLabs.ai

TechStudioLabs.ai is a **bootstrapped engineering organization** building practical tools in the **education and freelance ecosystem**.

We focus on:
- Solving real, narrow problems
- Shipping usable software under constraints
- Learning by building production systems, not demos

This is an **early-stage setup**. Clarity, ownership, and execution matter more than titles or credentials.

---

## What we are building

We are working on tools around:
- Education workflows and skill validation  
- Project-based collaboration and freelance workflows  
- Internal systems to manage learning, tasks, and outcomes  

Each repository represents a **specific problem** with its own scope, README, and roadmap.

There is no idea dumping here — only buildable problems.

---

## How we work

This organization follows a **simple but strict workflow**.

### Tools
- **GitHub** → source of truth (code, issues, roadmap)
- **GitHub Projects** → Kanban task tracking
- **Slack** → async communication and discussions
- **Google Calendar** → meetings only when required

### Core principles
- Output > effort  
- Async > meetings  
- Small PRs > big rewrites  
- One task → one owner  
- If it’s not in GitHub, it doesn’t exist  

---

## Repository workflow

- Every task is tracked as a **GitHub Issue**
- All changes happen via **Pull Requests**
- Direct pushes to `main` are not allowed
- PRs must:
  - Solve one clear problem
  - Have a short description
  - Be reviewable

GitHub Projects is used for visibility, **not micromanagement**.

---

## For interns / contributors

We sometimes collaborate with interns and early-career builders through **project-based trials**.

### What you’ll get
- Real production-level work
- Clear problem statements
- Exposure to real constraints and decisions
- Honest feedback on your work

### What we expect
- Ability to work independently
- Clear communication
- Comfort with GitHub, PRs, and async updates
- Ownership of assigned tasks

This is **not**:
- A classroom
- A tutorial-based internship
- A guaranteed job

It is a place to prove you can build.

---

## Onboarding expectations

If you are part of the team:
1. Join Slack and read pinned messages
2. Get access only to relevant repositories
3. Pick up your first GitHub Issue
4. Start small, ship fast

If you’re blocked for more than **24 hours**, communicate.

Silence is worse than mistakes.

---

## Code & access

- All repositories are private by default
- Access is granted based on role and responsibility
- Interns and contributors only see what they need
- Admin access is restricted

Security and focus matter more than convenience.

---

## Communication guidelines

- Use Slack channels, not DMs, for work
- Keep messages short and actionable
- Avoid vague updates — post progress in Issues
- Decisions should be documented, not remembered

Important discussions should always leave a written trail.

---

## Status of the organization

TechStudioLabs.ai is evolving.

Processes, repositories, and scope will change — but the core principles won’t:
- Build real things
- Respect time
- Stay honest about constraints

---

## Contact & collaboration

If you are already connected:
- Use GitHub Issues or Slack

For collaboration discussions:
- Reach out through existing channels

Cold pitches, spam, or generic proposals are ignored.

_This organization is small by design. The work is not._
