# TechStudioLabs.ai

We are a small, bootstrapped engineering team building practical tools in the **education and freelance ecosystem**.

We focus on:
- Solving real problems
- Shipping usable software
- Learning by building, not by theory

This is an early-stage organization. We value **execution, clarity, and ownership** over credentials.

---

## What we are building
We are working on internal and external tools around:
- Education workflows
- Skill validation
- Freelance / project-based collaboration

Details live inside individual repositories.

---

## How we work
- GitHub is the source of truth
- All work is tracked via Issues and Projects
- All code changes happen through Pull Requests
- Progress > perfection

Short feedback loops. Real constraints.

---

## For interns / contributors
We occasionally work with interns and early-career builders through **project-based trials**.

What you can expect:
- Real production-level work
- Clear problem statements
- Ownership of small but meaningful components
- Honest feedback

What we expect:
- Ability to work independently
- Communication through GitHub + Slack
- Output-driven mindset

This is not a classroom or tutorial setup.

---

## Repositories
Access to repositories is granted based on role and contribution.

If you’re part of the team, check the repo README for:
- Setup instructions
- Contribution guidelines
- Task boards

---

## Contact
For collaboration or inquiries, reach out via:
- GitHub issues (where applicable)
- Direct communication if already connected

_This organization is evolving. So is the work._
